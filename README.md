# HPO Workbench
A Java app for working with the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO).

A Java app for working with HPO and HPO annotation data. Still in a very preliminary phase. 
The app currently can download the hp.obo file and transform it to a TSV file.

```
$ mvn package
$ java -jar hpowbgui/target/hpoawbgui-0.0.3-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
Some of the functionality is also available in the cli module.
