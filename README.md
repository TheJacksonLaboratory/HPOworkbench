# HPO Workbench
A Java app for working with the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO).

A Java app for working with HPO and HPO annotation data. HPO Workbench can be used to get an overview of the HPO by navigating
through the hierarchy and displaying the term definition etc. 

Please see the [full documentation](http://hpo-workbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Download current release

A Windows executable (HPOWorkbench.exe) can be downloaded here.

https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/HPOworkbench/releases/tag/v0.1.10

A Jar file is provided for Macintosh and linux platforms.

A double click on these files should start the program. Please do not forget to
download the HPO ontology file (hp.obo) and the HPO annotations from the edit menu
the first time you use HPO Workbench. Unfortunately it is necessary to restart HPO Workbench 
after downloading these files (we are working on a fix). 

This is a "pre-release" that may contain bugs, although we have tested the code and it works.
Please see the documentation at http://hpo-workbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ for further
information on how to use HPO Workbench to navigate the ontology and to submit
suggestions for new terms or other comments to the HPO team.
