# HPO Workbench
A Java app for working with the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO).

A Java app for working with HPO and HPO annotation data. HPO Workbench can be used to get an overview of the HPO by navigating
through the hierarchy and displaying the term definition etc. 

Please see the [full documentation](http://hpo-workbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
