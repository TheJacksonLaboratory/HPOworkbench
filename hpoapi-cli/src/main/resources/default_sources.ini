; INI file with default data sources for Jannovar.
;
; This file is packed into the HPOAPI JAR file.
; Adapted from the Jannovar INI file and still work in progress.
;
; Each data source is described in one section. By convention, the section
; and data source name is given as "${organism}/${source}". Jannovar will
; serialize the file to "${name}.replace('/', '_').replace("\", "_").
;
; Users can provide their own INI files using the --data-source parameter
; to Jannovar, even orriding the defaults from this file.
;
; Each section contains a "type" entry that will make Jannovar use the
; appropriate DataSource and JannovarDataFactory type for downloading and
; parsing.
;
; Aliasing
; ========
;
; The mitochondrial chromosome has the key "MT" in RefSeq but "M" in UCSC.
; Thus, we allow to create manual aliasing that is executed after loading the
; chrToAccessions file from RefSeq and before loading the chromInfo file from
; UCSC. Each line has the "alias" key. The value "MT,M,chrM" means that the
; contig names "M" and "chrM" are aliased to the contig name "MT" that is
; already known from the chrToAccessions file.
;
; Note that all alias lines are processed in linear order. If the name in the
; first entry of the list is not known yet then it is created with the next
; free number. This is useful for adding a adding the missing MT chromosome
; entry for hg18, for example.
